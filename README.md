Description The first assignment is designed to provide students with an opportunity to practice the development of specific user interface features that are made available within the Android system. The tasks are designed to be specific, and there is little need to go beyond the standard Android documentation, text book and sample code provided during the class. The assignment also serves as a measure of some of the task that students should be familiar with especially when preparing for the lab exam and the final exam. While there are some components not fully covered in the class, the implementation is straight forward and will provide a good opportunity to develop the studentâ€™s programming in Java and in the Android ecosystem. A Sample application will be provided with the description to give students a reference point of how the features should work and be implemented.

Tasks Build an application to demo the following functionality: 1. UI Components 2. Layouts 3. Dialogs 4. Toasts 5. Snackbars 6. Activities 7. Adapters 8. ActionBar 9. Menus 10. Menu/Detail Layouts.

The application will provide a list to select the implemented functionality. A proposal of the list is demonstrated in figure 1. Within each of the functionality listed, you are expected to complete a set of subtasks related to the specific tasks. The following sections will provide further details on what is required for each section:

UI Components Implement a form that will look similar to the screenshot provided. The data submitted in section A will appear in section B when the save button is pressed.

Layouts Implement the design illustrated above using only Linear Layouts and Buttons.

Toasts and Snack Bars Implement Code that will demonstrate the four items in the list: Toast Short Will display a message using the Toast.LENGTH_SHORT Toast Long Will display a message using the Toast.LENGTH_LONG SnackBar Demonstrates the display of a message using the snack bar SnackBar Action Demonstrates the snack bar with a message but also a button that performs an additional task

Dialogs Alert Utilizes the AlertDialog to generate a simple alert Confirm Utilizes the AlertDialog to present users with a choice and perform a different action based on the choice selected Date Allows the user to select a date List Presents a list of items within a dialog. It allows the user to select a single value from the list Multiple Choice List Presents a list of items within a dialog. It allows the user to select multiple items from the list

Activity Bundle Demonstrates the passing of information while opening of an activity. The system must demonstrate that the information was successfully passed to newly launched activity.

Activity for Result Demonstrates passing of the information from a newly launched activity, to the activity that started it. If activity A opens activity B, the information is passed from B to A.

Custom Adapter Create a custom list that shows both an image and text for each item. A bonus 2 marks will be added for a button that displays information for the individual item.

Fragment Demonstrate the use of a fragment within an activity. Fragment Utilize a simple fragment to render content View Pager Use the ViewPager class to implement a set of horizontal sliding pages (3) Link WebViewFragment Load a Browser page within the WebViewFragment Link

ActionBar and Menus Demonstrate the inclusion of buttons within the Action bar and the addition of more than 2 items within the menu. Link

Master/Detail Layout Demonstrate the utilization of the master detail layout for the items from lab 4.
